### Install steps

1. Install NodeJS v0.10
2. Install Docker and Docker compose
3. Modify your vhost so ldir.ro and api.ldir.ro point to 127.0.0.1
4. Configs are loaded based on env. The env is controlled by NODE_ENV in
[docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml)
5. Server configs can be found in [environment](server/config/environment/)
6. Default values are set [server/config/environment/index.js](server/config/environment/index.js)
The others just overwrite based on NODE_ENV
7. [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) clones as close as possible the structure that we deploy in production
8. [docker-stack.yaml](docker-stack.yaml) controls the deployment infrastructure to the cloud
9. run in the root `docker-compose up` . To detach run with the flag `-d`
10. To stop the infrastructure run `docker-compose down`

## User Manual

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JalrzTIXh64KuRByPnxv362upNtSUxgByR20kovoHEM/edit?usp=sharing) you can find the user manual.



## Notes
1. Remote error reporting is handle trough [sentry.io](https://sentry.io)
2. If you have problems with node/kue services not connecting to the local machine
when runing rm -rf ~/ldir-volumes/
3. [Dockerfile-node.yaml](Dockerfile-node.yaml)  handles the kue/api services container definition
4. [Dockerfile-static.yaml](Dockerfile-static.yaml)  handles the static web app container definition
5. To seed the db run `docker-compose exec node /bin/bash -l -c 'node server/seed.js'`
6. To initialize the elastic search index run `docker-compose exec node /bin/bash -l -c 'node server/elasticReset.js'`
7. To login in one of the containers run `docker-compose exec <<servicename>> /bin/bash` . Now you will be in the containers cli

## Docker cloud notes

#### Main labels
node - this is for the cluster and machines that will run our api
kue,redis - this is for the cluster and machines that will run queue service composed of kue and redis db

mongo- runs our mongo cluster and replica sets
Here we have also the following set manually to each machine
mongo1 - runs the main primary mongo
mongo2, mongo2- run the secondary machine


el - elastic search label
lb - load balancer
webspa - our web single page application

the only front facing service should be our load balancer. We leverage vhosts to  lb our requests

#### Recommendations
lb and webspa can run on the same machine without issues
mongo1 should have a dedicated machine and is for the time being our most vulnerable point during a high traffic period
mongo2, mongo3 can run on the same machine
due, redis should run in a separated cluster

# API documentation 


The GET routes generally use query params (ex: uri?param=x), but some of them can use route params (ex: uri/:param).

In places where the query params are used, the params can be sent in any order and some of them are optional. The default values for the optional params will always be the ones in the table below, in the route column.

In places where the route params are used, the params must be sent in the specified order, they are all mandatory and they do not have a default value

In places where the body params are used, the body must be sent as json with the keys being those params.

The mandatory params are marked red and they never have a default value.

Some of the routes support pagination, as marked in the table below. For these routes, you can send two additional query params: page and limit. By default, page=0&limit=10

API authentication is done via a token placed in the Authorization header. The user and its role are decoded from this token. The role allowed access is described in the Restriction column below

API actions can determine a lot of stuff to happen in the background, which is not visible in the response, but trust me, it happens. These are described in the Hooks column.

### Deployment ###

#### Building the app ####

Currently, there is no script for building the app. A workaround is to use "grunt serve:production" to start the app (which does the build for you), then stop the app 
And after build the containers for production and push the stack

```
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

#### Rebuilding the elastic search index ####

Before a new release, chances are the elastic search indexes need to be rebuild, due to changes in the database models. To do this, there is a sript you can run:

`docker-compose exec node /bin/bash -l -c 'node server/elasticReset.js'`

If everything is successful, the process will end with code 0

### API versioning ###

The API versioning works by running two apps from different branches and using nginx to proxy api requests to each one.

The following is an example config for running the old API on port 9000 and the new one one port 9001. The web app will use the new API. Mobile apps can use old or new.

The new API routes will be prefixed with "v2" and the old ones will remain the same (example: new route is "/api/v2/cities", old route is "/api/cities")

Modify "client/app/config.js", replace "/api/" with "/api/v2/" and "/auth/" with "/auth/v2/". This will tell the web app to use the new API.

```
(function(module){
    'use strict';
    module.constant('API_URL','/api/v2/')
          .constant('AUTH_URL', '/auth/v2/')
})(angular.module('ldrWebApp'));
```

Configure nginx. Here is an example config:

```
server {
      listen 80;
      server_name  example.com;
      location ^~ /api/v2 {
            rewrite ^/api/v2/(.*)$ /api/$1 break;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_pass http://localhost:9001;
      }
      location ^~ /api {
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_pass http://localhost:9000;
      }
      location ^~ /auth/v2 {
            rewrite ^/auth/v2/(.*)$ /auth/$1 break;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_pass http://localhost:9001;
      }
      location ^~ /auth {
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_pass http://localhost:9000;
      }
      location / {
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_pass http://localhost:9001;
      }
}
```

Start the old app (from branch dev) with "node server/app.js" (it will start on default port 9000)

Start the new app (from branch develop) with "PORT=9001 node server/app.js"
